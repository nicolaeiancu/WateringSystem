# WateringSystem

 <br>
 Watering system based on soil humidity with <b> ESP32 </b>, <b> FC-28 soil moisture sensor </b>, <b> RS-360 Water pumping motor </b> and <b> Arduino IDE </b>. <br> <br>
 After measuring the soil moisture with a sensor, the system decides if it needs to be watered or not. If yes, it turns the water pump for a specific amount of time and then proceeds to measure the moisture again.
